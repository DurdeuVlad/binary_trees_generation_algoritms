<h1>Binary Tree Algorithms in C</h1><p>This repository contains multiple C solutions for algorithm problems involving binary trees. All the solutions have been implemented in CLion.</p><h2>Problems</h2><h3>Problem 1</h3><p>The problem involves creating a binary tree from a mathematical expression in pre-order notation. The expression can contain zero or more operators, and the operators can be <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or <code>*</code>. For example, <code>+12</code> represents <code>1 + 2</code>, <code>+324</code> represents <code>(3 + 2) * 4</code>, and <code>-9*4-5</code> represents <code>9 - (4 * 5) - 5</code>. The following tasks need to be performed:</p><ol><li>Create a binary tree for the given expression.</li><li>Write a function to evaluate the expression in the subtree rooted at the given node.</li><li>For each operand in the expression, print the operators that apply to it in the correct order.</li></ol><h3>Problem 2</h3><p>The problem involves creating a binary search tree from a file containing <code>n</code> words. The tree needs to be printed in pre-order. Then, a word <code>cu</code> is read from the input. If this word is present in the tree, it needs to be deleted and the resulting tree needs to be printed.</p><h3>Problem 3</h3><p>The problem involves evaluating a postfix expression read from a file. The operators used can be binary additive operators <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, binary multiplicative operators <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>, and unary sign change operators <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>. The following tasks need to be performed:</p><ol><li>Build a binary tree for the expression read from the file.</li><li>Each node in the tree should contain either an operator or an operand.</li><li>Print the tree in a visually appealing manner.</li></ol><h3>Problem 4</h3><p>The problem involves generating a perfectly balanced binary search tree from a sorted vector of keys. A binary search tree is said to be perfectly balanced if the difference between the number of nodes in its left and right subtrees is at most 1 for every node. The following tasks need to be performed:</p><ol><li>Generate a perfectly balanced binary search tree from the sorted vector of keys.</li><li>Print the resulting tree in a visually appealing manner.</li><li>Implement the balancing using rotations, as in the AVL tree.</li></ol><h2>Usage</h2><p>To use any of the solutions, clone the repository and open the project in CLion. Each solution has been implemented in a separate file, with its own main function.</p><h2>License</h2><p>This repository is licensed under the MIT License.
