Binary Tree Algorithms in C
This repository contains multiple C solutions for algorithm problems involving binary trees. All the solutions have been implemented in CLion.

Problems
Problem 2
The problem involves creating a binary tree from a mathematical expression in pre-order notation. The expression can contain zero or more operators, and the operators can be +, -, or *. For example, +12 represents 1 + 2, +324 represents (3 + 2) * 4, and -9*4-5 represents 9 - (4 * 5) - 5. The following tasks need to be performed:

Create a binary tree for the given expression.
Write a function to evaluate the expression in the subtree rooted at the given node.
For each operand in the expression, print the operators that apply to it in the correct order.
Problem 3
The problem involves creating a binary search tree from a file containing n words. The tree needs to be printed in pre-order. Then, a word cu is read from the input. If this word is present in the tree, it needs to be deleted and the resulting tree needs to be printed.

Problem 4
The problem involves evaluating a postfix expression read from a file. The operators used can be binary additive operators + and -, binary multiplicative operators * and /, and unary sign change operators + and -. The following tasks need to be performed:

Build a binary tree for the expression read from the file.
Each node in the tree should contain either an operator or an operand.
Print the tree in a visually appealing manner.
Problem 5
The problem involves generating a perfectly balanced binary search tree from a sorted vector of keys. A binary search tree is said to be perfectly balanced if the difference between the number of nodes in its left and right subtrees is at most 1 for every node. The following tasks need to be performed:

Generate a perfectly balanced binary search tree from the sorted vector of keys.
Print the resulting tree in a visually appealing manner.
Implement the balancing using rotations, as in the AVL tree.
Usage
To use any of the solutions, clone the repository and open the project in CLion. Each solution has been implemented in a separate file, with its own main function.
